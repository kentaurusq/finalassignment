  <h1 style="text-align:center;">BTS 2017 </h1>
  <p> Last Year, BTS was climbing to the top of the Billboards. Some say that 2017 was their most successful year. The members of this group uploaded some of their works onto the popular media tool "SoundCloud". The boys also had the opportunity to be featured on the Jimmy Kimmel show, and gave their fans a mini concert. BTS has done many collaborations with other artists such as Steve Aoki and Desiigner. This year, they released a teaser for their upcoming tour "Love Yourself", and a teaser to Jimin's solo "Serendipity". In 2017, they went on "Wings" Tour which was leaning towards an R and B and Hip Hop kind of feeling to it. BTS also partnered with a messaging application called "LINE" and created characters matching each of their individual personalities. Nearing the end of the year they earned a spot in the American Music Awards(AMA).  </p>

  <h1 style="text-align:center;"> Songs </h1>
  <p> From 2017, I absolutely recommend listening to "Mic Drop ft. Steve Aoki(Remix)" if you have not heard it already. "Spring Day" is one of my favourites as well because of the lighter kind of feeling the song gives out compared to the rest of their songs. "Pied Piper" is also one of their songs that would fit this lighter vibe and is definitely one I would recommend. </p>

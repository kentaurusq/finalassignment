  <h1 style="text-align:center;">BTS 2018 </h1>
  <p>I was first introduced to BTS when their song "DOPE" made its debut in 2015. Since then, I have been a fan and supporter of their music. Three years later, this group has clearly improved dramatically, and their popularity is at its peak. This year had to be the most inspiring year for them because I got to see them perform live at the First Ontario Center in Hamilton. Prior to the concert, they released a teaser to a solo for each member. Each of their songs followed a certain theme and the name of their tour “LOVE YOURSELF”. 
  <br/>
  As a group they are even stronger, and they work as a team on stage and off stage for us, their fans.</p>

  <h1 style="text-align:center;"> Songs </h1>
  <p> My top songs that I would recommend to someone else is Jimin’s “Serendipity”, Jungkook’s “Euphoria, and Suga’s “Seesaw”. Other songs from this year that I would recommend someone to listen to is ”Fake Love”, “Idol”, and “Magic Shop”. </p>
